# 🧠 Digital Diet Tracker: What Are You Feeding Your Brain?

## 📌 Overview
In a world where we track steps, calories, and sleep... what about our **screen time**?

This project analyzes digital content consumption as a **nutrition label for your brain**. Using Python and Excel, I created a tracker that classifies content into **Protein (Learning)**, **Carbs (Neutral)**, and **Sugar (Toxic)** — calculating a **Digital Nutrition Score** for every user and platform.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To visualize and reflect on how users consume digital content, and how that impacts **mental productivity**, **focus**, and **well-being** — similar to how food affects physical health.

## 🧠 Digital Nutrition Model

| Category       | Digital Macro | Score Weight |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Learning       | Protein        | +2.0         |
| Entertainment  | Carbs          | +0.5         |
| Social         | Carbs          | +0.5         |
| Toxic          | Sugar          | -1.5         |

## 📁 What's Inside

| Sheet Name                   | Description                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `DIGITAL MACRO BREAKDOWN`   | Pie chart showing time split by macro type  |
| `TOTAL MINS BY CATEGORY`    | Total minutes by content category            |
| `Nutrition Score over time` | Trendline showing weekly nutrition changes   |
| `top&bottom10 ns`           | Best and worst users by digital health score |
| `PLATFORM NUTRITION IMPACT` | Platform-level impact breakdown              |

> The data was simulated using Python for 200 users across 30 days.

## 📊 Key Insights
- YouTube & LinkedIn = 🥦 brain food (high protein)
- TikTok & Twitter = 🍩 digital junk (high sugar)
- 38% of users had a net-negative nutrition score
- Swapping 30 min of “sugar content” per day boosts score by 20%+

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** – Synthetic data generation, scoring engine
- **Excel** – PivotTables, charts, formatting, trendlines

---

## 📎 How It Works
1. Simulated digital activity across platforms
2. Mapped each platform to a category and macro type
3. Assigned weighted nutrition scores based on content type
4. Built Excel dashboards to visualize habits and patterns

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Real-time screen time tracker via browser or mobile API
- Personal recommendations & daily nutrition goals
- Power BI / Streamlit interactive version

## 🙋 About Me – Namratha Ganga ⚔️📊

Hi, I'm **Namratha Ganga** — a data-driven warrior currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Analytics and Information Systems** at **Texas State University** 🏛️.

This project? A wild idea that hit me one night:
> _“What if screen time was like food for your brain?”_

From that single thought, I built a full-fledged **Digital Diet Tracker** — turning behavioral data into something you can **see, score, and act on**. Think of it as a **nutrition label for your screen time.**

🧠 I used **Excel** for analytics and dashboards, and I’m currently building out the **SQL and Python** versions next:
- SQL for querying patterns across user behavior
- Python for automation, backend pipelines, and possibly even a real-time web dashboard

I'm actively looking for **full-time roles** in **Data Analytics**, **BI**, or **Data Science** where I can blend creativity with code — and tell stories through numbers that matter.

> If you're into bold ideas, brain food, and data with personality — let’s connect.
